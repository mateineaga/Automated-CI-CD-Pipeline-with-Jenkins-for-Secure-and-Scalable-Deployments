# Automated-CI-CD-Pipeline-with-Jenkins-for-Secure-and-Scalable-Deployments
Designed and implemented a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins and EC-2 agents to automate application building, testing, security scanning, and deployment. Developed multibranch and parameterized pipelines, integrating Docker, Trivy (vulnerability scanning), and Hadolint (Dockerfile linting) for security and compliance.
